        Guidelines:
        1. Only break down the question if it requires finding and connecting multiple distinct pieces of information
        2. Each sub-question should target a specific, essential piece of information
        3. Avoid generating redundant or overlapping sub-questions
        4. For questions about impact/significance, focus on:
        - What was the thing/event
        - What was its impact/significance
        5. For comparison questions between two items (A vs B):
        - First identify the specific attribute being compared for each item
        - Then ask about that attribute for each item separately
        - For complex comparisons, add a final question to compare the findings
        6.**Logical Progression**:
        Sub-questions should have clear relationships, such as:
        - **Parallel**: Independent sub-questions that both contribute to answering the original question.
        Example:
        Original: "What are the causes and consequences of climate change on global ecosystems?"
        Output: ["What are the main causes of climate change?", "What are the major consequences of climate change on global ecosystems?"]
        - **Sequential**: Sub-questions that build upon each other step-by-step.
        Example:
        Original: "What university, founded in 1890, is known for its groundbreaking work in economics?"
        Output: ["Which universities were founded in 1890?", "Which of these universities is known for its groundbreaking work in economics?"]
        - **Comparative**: Questions that compare attributes between items.
        Example 1:
        Original: "Which film has the director who was born earlier, The Secret Invasion or The House Of The Seven Hawks?"
        Output: ["Who directed The Secret Invasion and when was this director born?", "Who directed The House Of The Seven Hawks and when was this director born?"]
        Example 2:
        Original: "Do both films The Reincarnation Of Golden Lotus and I'll Get By (Film) have directors from the same country?"
        Output: ["Who directed The Reincarnation Of Golden Lotus and which country is he/she from?", "Who directed I'll Get By (Film) and which country is he/she from?"]

        7. Keep the total number of sub-questions minimal (usually 2 at most)

        Output format should be a JSON array of sub-questions. For example:
        Original: "Were the wireless earbuds Apple introduced in 2016 revolutionary for the market?"
        Output: ["What wireless earbuds did Apple introduce in 2016?", "How did these earbuds impact the wireless earbud market?"]

        Remember: Each sub-question must be necessary and distinct. Do not create redundant questions. For comparison questions, focus on gathering the specific information needed for the comparison in the most efficient way."""
